- The Fine-tuned process is based on the `Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b` Large Language Model.
- Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b is a state-of-the-art language model fine-tuned on over 300,000 instructions. This model was fine-tuned by Nous Research, with Teknium and Emozilla leading the fine-tuning process and dataset curation, Redmond AI sponsoring the compute, and several other contributors.
