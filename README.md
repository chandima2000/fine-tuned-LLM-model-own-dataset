# fine-tuned-LLM-model-own-dataset
- The Fine-tuned process is based on the `Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b` Large Language Model.
- In this project, the LLM model is fine-tuned using the Gradient.ai platform.
- Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b is a state-of-the-art language model fine-tuned on over 300,000 instructions. This model was fine-tuned by Nous Research, with Teknium and Emozilla leading the fine-tuning process and dataset curation, Redmond AI sponsoring the compute, and several other contributors.
- Here, I used a Python dictionary to import my own data set.
- Model is trained under 3 iterations.
- This is a basic illustration of how fine-tuning can perform to the LLM model using own data set.
